# Backend Test Heroku
Temporally repository to build and deploy the original hosted backend at heroku.
If u want to try the deploynment, please create your own branch and test the app until it works on heroku. 
Once done, do git merge on this repository, make it private and do a clean copy (replace files or delete and paste the files) on the original Backend repository and test it on heroku again.
